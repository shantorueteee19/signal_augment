# signal_augment
This function performs data augmentation by slicing a dataset into overlapping, fixed-length windows with evenly spaced start points. It generates multiple variations of the data to address class imbalance or enhance diversity.
Basically this augmentation technique was proposed in <h3>TEANet: A Transpose-Enhanced Autoencoder
Network for Wearable Stress Monitoring <\h3>
